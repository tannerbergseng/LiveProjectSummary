# LiveProjectSummary
Over the past 2 weeks I have been working with other students to create a travel website built with Django and Beautifulsoup. since this is the first time I have ever worked on a project of this caliber I learned a lot about how developing teams work together and I became more familiar with Gitbash and Django framework. I was tasked with creating suggested categories for users to use in a blog and adding them to the database. Since this was my first time working as a group and my first time using The Django framework there was a big learning curve for me but that being said I do have a better understanding of how Django works but more importantly I learned what it is like to work with a team in a professional setting and I can take that knowledge and experience with me in all future endeavors. I think it is fair to say what I learned in the past two weeks have been invaluable to me and my growth as a software developer.
